### neuralNet_tensorFlow (‚è≥ Currently working on this...)

Since the last project was about building a neural net from scratch, this project will be about using indsutry standard tools to build similar projects . I now understand how the neural networks are operating from my last project. I can now use powerful frameworks with a deeper understanding of how they are working.
